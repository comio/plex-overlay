[Plex](http://plex.tv/) is a service that allows convenient access to central media over a variety of devices. Plex Media Player is a new desktop client for Plex that includes a nice ten-foot interface and is designed for connecting to the television. Note: Plex Pass users can add the "~amd64" or "~x86" keywords to the packages to get the latest Plex Pass versions.
